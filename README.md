# Battlefield 1 Web UI

An attempt to recreate Battlefield 1 main menu in web using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Tailwind](http://tailwindcss.com). EA please don't sue me.

It's not exactly the same as the real Battlefield 1 UI, but it's similar, also it's not really interactive yet, but I will add new features if I have some spare time.

#### Demo: bf1.vincentjonathan.com
